## Post Weekend Project Comment

## Motivation
Learnt some new skills in July / August (async/await, promisses, Array.map), and I wanted to make a larger weekend project using these tools when the scenario come up

## Features
- Async/ Await
- Promisses
- Array functions

## Code Example / Misc things I learned during the project
- When adding a proxy to a package.json file, the React app will need to be manually restarted to get the updated proxy info
- When working with forms, place the onSubmit function call in the <Form> tags and not the <Button> tag
--If placed in the Button tag, the page will still refresh even with 'event.preventDefault()'
